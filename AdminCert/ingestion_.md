# ingestion inputs
- Data Administrator
    - inputs data
- System Administrator
    - instalation
    - manages indexes
    - licenses
    - configures security
    - monitors the platform
- DATA inputs
    - Data source configured to send to splunk
    - sends to the indexer where parsing happens
    - during indexing streams are turned into searchable events
- Types of inputs
    - files and folder (most common) .txt .log
    - TCP/UDP listener
    - HTTP event collector
    - Scripted input (any type of data) uses UF
    - Windows input (windows event log)
    - Add-ons (custom apps)
    - Splunk Web (directly add)
    - CLI (commads)
    - Modular inputs (write your own code)
    - FIFO stack?
- FISHBUCKET (UF makes sure the data is not read twice)
## Upload Data
- TYPES 
    - txt files .log .csv trace
    - pre-trained sourcetypes 
    - zip files (it unzips them)
    - need valid time stamps
- Sourcetype
    - catogorizes data
    - pretrained sourcetypes
    - defined in props.conf on indexer or HF
    - Pre-trained
        - Apps for specific types linux_messages_syslog, access_combined (apachi web server)
- Phases of indexing
    - Input phase
        - forwarder reads data
        - host, sorce, sourcetype added metadata
        - inputs.conf 
        - applied to entire data stream
    - Paring phase
        - broken into events
        - timestamp added
        - props.conf transforms.conf
        - individual events 
        - event level transformations
    - Indexing phases    
        - events segmented for searchability
        - index built
        - license meter runs (right before going to disk) based on amount flowing through
        - raw data and indexer data writen to disk
- Data pipeline
    - Parsing (character encoding line breaking)
    - Merging (timestramp extracted)
    - Typing (punctuation extration and regex)
    - Indexing pipeline (writen to disk)
- Index time vs Search time
    - index time
        - inputs.conf 
        - .conf file precedence used for these
        - etc/system/local takes precidence
    - search time 
        - user KT
        - .conf file precedence used for these
        - etc/users/<user>/app/local takes precidence
## DEMO
- custom sourcetype
    - check parsing and line breaker
